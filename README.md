# tic-tac-toe
ACS Unit 3 Lesson 5
Midterm - Tic-Tac-Toe
<br>

Summary
Create the game tic-tac-toe using a graphic user interface with images. The opposing players should use two images other than X and O. The game should display the rules and show player 1 and player 2 what images will be used for them to each play their x and o positions on the board. Things to consider:
- Use Tkinter to establish buttons for users to select playing location
- A player should not be able to utilize an already occupied spot
- The game should determine a winner if a win occurs
- If a tie occurs, the game should indicate such
- You may wish to use a geometry other than grid for this project

<br>

Additional features to consider:
- Allow each player to choose an image to use
- The option to play again
- Track wins by each side
- Play against an AI (find one and install, or create your own)
- Tic-Tac-Toe on a 4x4 grid but only requiring 3 in a row

When done, be sure to return to Google Classroom to answer questions in the posted document.
